Profile Summary
---------------

Software and machine learning engineer with the experiences in financial modeling, search engine development
, recommendation engine and content moderation system development.
In most cases, I led teams to accomplish the targets by sharing objectives, requirements and schedules. When assigning tasks to someone,
I think that the most important thing is delegating ownership and responsibility to motivate them.
